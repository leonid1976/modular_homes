          Our houses are built on the frame-panel construction technology using sandwich panels. <br><br>

          Structural Insulated Panels (SIP) are an advanced method of construction offering excellent thermal performance, light-weight structural strength and time and cost saving benefits over traditional construction methods or systems. SIP panels are used in floors, walls and roofs for residential, commercial and educational applications, providing ecologically friendly and energy efficient buildings.

        <div class="description technology__discription">
          Sandwich panel or structurally-insulated panel (SIP - Structural Insulated Panel) is a construction material with a three-layer structure that consists of two sheets of rigid material (OSB-3) and a layer of insulation between them (expanded polystyrene). All parts of sandwich panels are glued together by pressing. The main components of the sandwich panel are OSB-3 and expanded polystyrene.<br><br>

          “OSB-3” (orient stand board, "3" - moisture resistant) or wooden oriented strand board is a plate manufactured by pressing flat chips at high pressure and temperature conditions. The synthetic resin and paraffin emulsion are used as binders. <br><br>
          
          Expanded polystyrene is a gas-filled material made of polystyrene and its derivatives. Conventional expanded polystyrene formulation related to initial filling styrene granules with carbon dioxide (fire resistance purpose), which is dissolved in the polymer mass. Subsequently, the mass is exposed to steam heating. During this process there is a multiple bloating of initial granules until they occupy the entire block mold and agglomerate. As a result we get an eco-friendly, non-toxic, heat and sound insulation material, used in construction for over 40 years.

          <span class="bolder upper">Energy effeciency</span><br><br> 
          The biggest benefit of SIP panel technology is energy efficiency, which will last the life span of the building. This is due to the solid core of polyurethane (PUR) insulation throughout the structure which ensures that the building is heated evenly, remains free from cold spots and will benefit from reduced heating costs.         It’s a sad to have to overpay to heat and cool your home,  and with a SIP panel home you won't. In traditional homes, air leakage and improperly installed insulation can waste double digit percentage of the energy you pay to heat and cool your home. Typical homes have so many leaks, it's as if you have a window open during all the hot and cold days.

          <span class="bolder upper">Strength</span><br><br>
           Strength is another advantage when it comes to SIPs.     In terms of impact resistance, the SIPs we use are successfully lab tested for over 200 mph winds.            The continuous bonding of insulation offers incredible strength and resistance to impact. Vertical and horizontal stress loads are tested to be up to two times stronger than conventional stud walls. SIPs resist up to 6,000 pounds per foot, which results in structures that are stronger, straighter, taller, and wider than with other construction means.

        <div class="description technology__discription">
          <span class="bolder upper">Low wastage</span><br><br>
           SIPs are pre-engineered in a factory environment which results in less defects and wastage throughout              the manufacturing and construction processes. The job-ready feature of SIP panels cuts the amount of jobsite material waste in half if not more when compared to buildings constructed with regular dimensional lumber and framing materials.  Less waste is clearly better for our environment.

        <div class="description technology__discription">
          <span class="bolder upper">Fast construction</span><br><br>
          If you need to move into your home as fast as possible, SIPs construction is the way to do it. Compared to traditional construction, prebuilt homes take up to 60-70% less time to be completed. Or in other words, in many cases, you can expect to move into your new home in 3-4 months from selecting it. Although it may sound unbelievable, it totally makes sense considering how prebuilt homes are constructed in a climate-controlled environment. This eliminates any delays due to bad weather or other outside factors. What’s more, the house can be constructed in-factory at the same time that the foundations are being laid on-site, which significantly speeds up the whole process.
